  User Stories/build specs:
    1. Every Angular component must be in a separate script file.
    2. Must include a module called “todoApp”.
    3. Must include a controller called “TodoController.”
    4. The controller must add an array of sample todo objects to the view model. Each todo
    object has “task” (string) and “completed” (boolean). Include a mix of complete and
    incomplete items.
    5. The ngRepeat directive must be used.
    6. The ngClass directive must be used to add a “completed” class for completed todos.
    7. The ngIf directive must be used to remove the button “complete” button for
    completed todos.
    8. “x” buttons, “complete” buttons, the two inputs, and the “Add” button are all
    non-functional for now. Add them to the HTML and style them. We will make them work
    in the next lab.

  What does the application do?
    1. The user can add items to the bottom of the list. 
      -push to array on controller, ng-click on button, or ng-submit on form
    2. The user can filter the list. 
      - got this, ng-model & filter on the ng-repeated list items
  3. The user can remove items from the list, by clicking the “x”. 
    ng-click, remove/delete from array?
    4. The user can mark items complete by clicking the “complete” button. 
    ng-click - class strikethrough

  Build Specifications:
    1. Submitting the form calls a function named addTask that adds a new todo to the array
    with the complete property set to false. - mine does this without a form...
  2. Clicking the “x” on an item executes a function named removeTask that removes that
  item from the array.
    3. Clicking the “complete” button executes a function named completeTask that sets the
    task’s completed property to true.
    4. The text input at the top is for filtering. Typing into the filter text input uses an Angular
    filter to filter the items shown.

  Bonus: Give users the ability to edit the text of a todo.
